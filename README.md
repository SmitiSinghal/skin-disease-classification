# SKIN DISEASE CLASSIFICATION
 The project classifies the images into skin diseases using CNN and later explains the results using Explainable AI.


## ABOUT THE DATASET

Dataset Source: Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)

HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset - a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of pigmented lesions

The dermatoscopic images are collected from different populations, acquired and stored by different modalities. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images.

It has 7 different classes of skin cancer which are listed below :
- Melanocytic nevi
- Melanoma
- Benign keratosis-like lesions
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Actinic keratoses
- Vascular lesions
- Dermatofibroma


## The notebook includes :
- Data Cleaning and Visualization
- Prediction using ANN
- Prediction using CNN
- Transfer Learning
- XAI techniques to interpret the results: Feature Importance, LIME, SHAP, PDP
